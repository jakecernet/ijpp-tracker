Abstract and Reuse API Fetching Logic
• Consider creating custom hooks (for example, useFetch or useApi) that handle API calls, error handling, and caching. This will reduce duplicate code in App.jsx when fetching positions, bus stops, and arrivals.

Improve LocalStorage Integration
• Wrap localStorage get/set logic inside custom hooks to keep components cleaner (e.g., useLocalStorage).
• Ensure that state is only updated once on load and debounced before writing to storage if there are rapid changes.

Optimize Recalculations and Rendering
• Use the memoization hooks (useMemo, useCallback) as you already do. Double-check that dependencies are complete so that re-renders are minimized.
• Split heavy computations (like distance calculations) into separate, memoized functions or move them to a worker if the data size grows.

Debounce Search Inputs
• In tabs like arrivals and nearMe, implement debouncing for the search input. This will minimize unnecessary filtering on every key press.
• Use a custom hook (like useDebounce) or a library such as lodash.debounce.

Reduce Direct DOM Manipulation
• In settings.jsx, you use document.querySelectorAll and directly manipulate checkboxes. Instead, manage form state within React and update checkbox states using state variables.
• This change makes the code easier to test and debug.

Improve Error Handling and Loading States
• For network calls in App.jsx and other tabs, add proper loading/error UI feedback. This prevents UI flickers and informs the user in case of issues.

Structure and Component Separation
• Consider splitting large components (like the Map component in map.jsx) into smaller subcomponents. This can improve readability and maintainability.

Code Consistency and Clean-Up
• Remove redundant state updates (like re-setting state from localStorage in multiple useEffects).
• Ensure formatting consistency and avoid repeated utility functions by extracting them to a shared module.
